I've first tried Neoseiulus (formerly Amblyseius) californicus and cucumeris, but it's hard to say how well they performed. I suspect the relative humidity in my appartment and in my tents is too low; at least 60%, ideally 70% is recommended. I got some californicus because they should tolerate lower humidity, but thrips are not their preferred prey (they are better for spider mites, for example).

Then I tried Chrysopa (lacewing) larvae. They did seem to eat some thrips nymphs (I actually have video proof of that), but I have the feeling they like eating each other even more. They were really fun to watch but eventually I felt that it was *expensively* fun.

In February I got 100 Orius. They are small, very fast and can fly, so I was not able to watch their behavior like I could with the Chrysopa. I moved a few weeks later and didn't find any Orius in the new appartment. I believe I had too few thrips for them to settle, and I did not provide any additional food. They probably died of cannibalism and then hunger.

In late March, the thrips infestation got quite bad and, on a whim, decided to buy 2000 Orius nymphs as well as Ephestia (flour moth) eggs to feed them. I got some supplies to try and replicate the breeding setups I found in some research papers, with the goal of keeping them alive and breeding separately from the plants. I think I put around a third to half of them in petri dishes and a larger plastic box, and released the others all around on the plants. A week later I had adults in the enclosures, but they soon died because I did not maintain humidity.

However, the ones I released in my tent of Trichocereus seedlings matured and actually bred. In Mid April I found newly hatched nymphs.

I'm writing this in early May, I'm still seeing young nymphs and I don't know whether they hatched later or they are the third generation.

I haven't seen any thrips on my Trich seedlings and nearby for a week, ever since I watched a Orius nymph eat an adult thrips (I actually managed to make two videos of that, totaling more than one hour until the nymph threw the carcass away).
